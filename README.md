# Student-Management-using-PHP-AND-MYSQL
The Student Management System is a web-based application developed as part of a mini-project to efficiently manage student data using PHP and MySQL. This system is designed to automate the manual process of maintaining student records, ensuring data accuracy, and enabling quick access to information.

The project utilizes a combination of frontend and backend technologies. HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap are used for designing a user-friendly interface, while PHP is used for backend processing. MySQL serves as the relational database to store and retrieve student data. The project runs on the XAMPP server, which integrates Apache, PHP, and MySQL in a single package.

Key functionalities of the system include adding new student records, viewing all students in a tabular format, updating existing records, deleting unnecessary entries, and searching for students based on specific criteria like name or roll number. Each of these operations is handled using standard SQL queries through PHP, implementing full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

The "Add Student" module allows users to enter new student details, which are then inserted into the MySQL database. The "View Students" module retrieves and displays all records, while the "Edit" and "Delete" options offer functionality to update or remove existing data. The search functionality makes it easy to locate specific records without manually scanning the entire list.

This project showcases the practical implementation of SQL through real-world use cases and demonstrates how a backend database can be integrated with a web interface. It also reflects an understanding of database design, form handling, and dynamic content rendering.

Overall, the Student Management System enhances data management in educational institutions and serves as a strong foundation for learning web development and database integration.
